## Requirements


- Display a big timer (minutes and seconds).
- Four buttons:
  - **plus (+)** and **minus (-)**, they will allow the user to adjust the _minutes counter_ - **only when it's stopped**.
  - **start**, to run the timer (it will then change to **stop**), to serve as a _toggle_ button
  - **reset**, toâ€¦ reset the timer to its original value
- At the end of the timer, show a modal to invite user to _take a break_. The modal will have two buttons:
  - One to close the modal
  - Another to close the modal _and_ start a new timer
